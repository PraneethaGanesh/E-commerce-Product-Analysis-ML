# 🛍️ E-commerce Product Analysis using Machine Learning
## 📝 Description
This project analyzes product data from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform using advanced machine learning and data science techniques. It combines unsupervised learning (clustering) and supervised learning (classification) to discover product groupings and predict product categories. Integrated SQL queries and comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) add robustness to the analysis pipeline.

## ✨ Features

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Insights into price distributions, rating trends, product categories, etc.  
- Visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

🔍 **Unsupervised Learning**  
- DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering to group similar products  
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

🧠 **Supervised Learning**  
- Classification models to predict product categories  
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

🗃️ **SQL Integration**  
- Uses SQL queries to extract insights directly from the dataset

📂 **Clean Workflow**  
- Structured pipeline for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
